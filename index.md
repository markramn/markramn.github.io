**Customer Churn:** XGBoost model in Python

<div style="text-align: justify">Using open-sourced data to illustrate a POC engagement with a customer, the goal of this analysis was not only to predict which customers are at risk of churning, but understanding the reasons/factors behind high churn probability. </div>

**Customer Clustering:** PCA & KMeans models in Python

<div style="text-align: justify">Using open-sourced data to illustrate a POC engagement with a customer, the goal of this analysis was to segregate customers into an ideal number clusters, using PCA and Variance analysis to identify the ideal number. Once this is done, we use KMeans unsupervised learning to segregate customers into the required number of clusters. The final step is to create a summary profile of each cluster by predominant cluster features. </div>
